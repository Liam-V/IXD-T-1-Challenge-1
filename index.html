                    <h3> Let's go Digital </h3>
                    <p>
                        It was in the nineties when the web started to conquer the world. It was around this time that
                        designers started to make the transition from paper to pixels. This was in part made possible
                        by David Siegel who wrote a book called: Creating Killer Websites. The book contained Table and
                        Gif techniques which enabled designers to replicate pages which they previously made on print.

                    <h3>How to lay it out? </h3>
                    <p>
                        Around the end of the millennium designers where convinced by a number of assumptions <br>

                        - Everyone used a device capable of displaying a grid of 960 pixels.<br>
                        - Everyone used a (modern) web browser<br>
                        - Uses where in possession of an internet which made making file sizes smaller redundant. <br>
                        <br>

                        This created a spilt amongst designers there where primarily two groups: <br> One group which
                        held to believe that only using HTML and CSS was enough to design websites. Then there was
                        another group which pleaded for the use of Photoshop (or some other tool) to be able to design
                        websites. This group was somewhat ignored.

                    <p>
                        This discussion ended when a man named Steve Jobs revealed the iPhone. This device had the
                        capability to show HTML web pages.
                        This in contrast to other devices who could only show WML (Wireless Markup Language)

                    <p>
                        The idea that the web had only size was slowly fading around this time. Designers had to
                        accepted that this was an ideal situation, but one which didn’t work out.

                        Designers where now forced to design layouts for multiple viewing formats (from small to big).
                        This meant having to put more effort into the design process and more testing of layouts.

                        It was in April of 2010 that Ethan Marcotte wrote about the concept of Responsive design.
                        Specifically, how responsive design was used in Architectural designs.

                    <p>
                        Luke Wrobleswksi was responsible for coining the phrase ‘Mobile First’. He came up with the
                        phrase after seeing a rise in use mobile devices. The term means that design is prioritised for
                        mobile devices and then come computers and laptops.

                    <p>
                        It was Stephanie and Bryan Rieger who expanded the mobile first approach. They said that the
                        lack of media query was in fact the first media query.

                        The mobile first approach steps back from the devices. It focuses more on the content (which
                        include amongst others: text, images and tasks). More specifically how this is displayed at
                        different resolutions.

                        Back in the day web design was done solely by the designers. The users weren’t consolidated on
                        any decision relating to design of a website. Today this has changed the user is often called
                        in to sit down with the designer to discuss how the website should work, look and feel. User
                        first on could say.
